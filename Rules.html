    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <p>Image formation by concave and convex mirrors is a part of ray optics.There are
    4 rules each for image formation by concave and convex mirrors.In this session we will 
    study those rules.I have also provided you ray diagrams for image formation by concave and convex mirrors.You can access the by clicking <a href="https://codepen.io/rtdegmgt-the-reactor/pen/MWZWWOy">here.</a></p>
    For your ease I have given a table on which you can click to see the rule you are looking for.
